% input: f -> a 9-joint robot encoded as a SerialLink class
%        qInit -> 1x9 vector denoting current joint configuration
%        posGoal -> 3x1 vector describing goal position
%        epsilon -> scalar denoting how close end effector must be before
%                   loop terminates
%        velocity -> scalar denoting desired velocity of end effector
% output: traj -> nx9 matrix that denotes arm trajectory. Each row denotes
%                 a joint configuration. The first row is the first
%                 configuration. The last is the last configuration in the
%                 trajectory.
