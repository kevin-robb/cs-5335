% Input: odo -> 2xT matrix containing odometry readings for T time steps
%        zind -> 1xT vector containing the observed landmark index for
%                T time steps; index is 0 if no landmark observed
%        z -> 1xT cell array containing the (range, bearing) observation
%             for T time steps; z{t} is empty if no observation at time t
%        V -> 2x2 matrix denoting the process noise in (forward, angular)
%        W -> 2x2 matrix denoting the sensing noise in (range, bearing)
%        x0 -> 3x1 vector denoting the initial vehicle state mean
%        P0 -> 3x3 matrix denoting the initial vehicle state covariance
%        map -> Robotics toolbox Map object containing the known map
%               (known landmarks) for localization
% Output: x_est -> 1xT cell array containing the vehicle state mean
%                  for T time steps (i.e., x_est{t} is a 3x1 vector)
%         P_est -> 1xT cell array containing the vehicle state covariance
%                  for T time steps (i.e., P_est{t} is a 3x3 matrix)

function [x_est, P_est] = E1(odo, zind, z, V, W, x0, P0, map)
